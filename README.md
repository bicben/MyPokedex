# MyPokedex
A toy app written on Kotlin to learn several technologies (for myself)

The app is using https://pokeapi.co/ https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi API which is free of charge and free of authentication requirement. 
Make sure to donate to it to keep it up, also follow it's fair use policy https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html#fairuse.
One of the rules is to cache the query results which is done in this app using rxjava2 and Room.
